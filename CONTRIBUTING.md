## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [AntCodeHub Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

If you find a bug, please make sure the bug hasn't already been reported by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/your-username/antcodehub/issues).

If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/your-username/antcodehub/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample or an executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Suggesting Enhancements

If you have an idea for a new feature or an improvement to an existing one, please open an issue to discuss it. This allows us to coordinate our efforts and prevent duplication of work.

### Pull Requests

1.  **Fork the repository** and create your branch from `main`.
2.  **Set up your development environment** by following the instructions in the `README.md`.
3.  **Make your changes.** Ensure your code follows the existing style and conventions.
4.  **Add or update tests** if necessary. We want to maintain good code coverage.
5.  **Ensure your code lints.** Run the linter to check for any issues.
6.  **Issue that pull request!** Make sure to link any relevant issues in your PR description.

## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

-   Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
-   Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...").
-   Limit the first line to 72 characters or less.
-   Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line.

### TypeScript Styleguide

All TypeScript code must adhere to the configuration set in `tsconfig.json`. We use Prettier for code formatting, which should be run automatically by your editor or as a pre-commit hook.

Thank you for your contribution!
